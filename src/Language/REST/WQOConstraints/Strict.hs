type WQO = WQO.WQO

-- Represents a set of constraints on a WQO on type `a`

-- The constraints are represented as a set ws of WQOs
-- The constraints permit any WQO w that is a valid extension of some (w' in wqos)

-- | @StrictOC ws@ represents constraints on a WQO. Each element of @ws@ is a WQO
--   that satisfies the constraints. @StrictOC ws@ permits a WQO @w@ if there exists
--   a @w'@ in @ws@ such that @w'@ can be extended to yield @w@.
--
--   This implementation is similar to disjunctive normal form representation of
--   logical formulas; except in this case each "conjunction" is a valid WQO, and thus
--   "satisfiable". Therefore @StrictOC ws@ satisfies /some/ WQO iff @ws@ is not empty.
--
--   Two potential downsides to this implementation are:
--   1. The size of @ws@ can grow quickly; an inherent issue of DNF
--   2. Related, calculating the entire set @ws@ is computationally expensive,
--      and often unnecessary for RESTs use-case, where continuing the path only
--      requires knowing if /any/ WQO is permitted.
